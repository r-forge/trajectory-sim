## Implements the equal-time distance between a pair of trajectories

"equal.time" <- function(t1, t2, pd=euclidian) {
	## t1 and t2 are a pair of trajectories, for example obtained using
	#	data(example_traj)
	#	example.traj[[1]]
	## pd is a distance metric for points on the trajectories,
	## which defaults to the euclidian distance.
	
	## The output should be the equal-time distance between t1 and t2.
